    <h2>Soba noodles are perfect for a summer day</h2>
    <p>Soba Noodles are made from buckwheat flour and served with soy sauce-based dipping sauce called <strong> Tsuyu </strong>.</strong></p>
    <p>In japan they would call this dish <strong>Zaru Soba</strong> and the word <em>zaru</em> means "a strainer" in Japanese and the name of the dish was derived from the way the noodles are served over a bamboo strainer during the Edo Period.</p>
    <p>For this recipe we will be showing how to make the dipping sauce. It is easy to find ready made soba noodles from your local asian grocery store. 10-minutes is all you need to have a refreshing cold dish! </p>
    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Servings: 4</h4>
    <h4>For Mentsuyu Sauce: Makes 1 cup concentrated sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup Sake.</li>
        <li>½ cup mirin</li>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 Kombu (dried kelp) <em>(1"x1", 2.5cmx 2.5cm)</em></li>
        <li>1 cup katsuboshi (dried bonito flakes) <em>(they are fluffy, so make sure to compress when measuring)</em></em></li>    
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all Ingredients</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, add ¼ cup sake and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Let the alcohol evaporate for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Add ½ cup soy sauce and ½ cup mirin (I add + 1 Tbsp mirin for my family's preference).</li>
        <li>Add 1 x 1 inch (2.5 x 2.5 cm) kombu and 1 cup dried bonito flakes (katsuobushi).      </li>
        <li>Bring it to a boil and cook on low heat for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and let cool completely. Strain the sauce and set aside. You can keep the sauce in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for up to a month.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>To Serve:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>You will need <strong>90 ml (6 Tbsp)</strong> of dipping sauce <strong>per cup/person</strong>, which means 360 ml (1 ½ cup) for 4 servings. Since the sauce to water ratio is roughly 1:3, combine <strong>1 part</strong> (90 ml) of dipping sauce and <strong>3 parts</strong> (270 ml) of iced water in a measuring cup and check the taste. If it's salty, add more water. If it's diluted, add more sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Put chopped green onions and wasabi on a small plate and serve with the soba noodles.
        </li>
    </ol>
